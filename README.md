# PL_Project
This project is a multi-language lexical analyzer built with Flex. It allows users to select C, Python, or Java source code and performs lexical analysis to tokenize the input. The analyzer identifies keywords, identifiers, operators, constants, delimiters, and punctuators, providing a foundation for further compiler or interpreter development.
